GantSign Ltd. was founded in 2007 as a software and software consultancy
company. The name is a portmanteau of "elegant" and "design"; it is through
elegant design that software best meets the needs of a business rather than
being an obstacle holding that business back.

The Oxford English dictionary defines
[elegance](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/elegance) as:

> The quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple

In software an elegant design is typically one that:

* fulfills it's purpose
* is easy to test
* prioritizes common requirements & uses cases
* focuses on getting the maximum benefit with the fewest features and least cost
* focuses on doing a small number of things well rather than a great many things poorly
* is intuitive
* leverages familiar patterns
* favours readability over conciseness but tries to do both
* encourages best practice
* is self documenting
* minimizes the scope for bugs
* encourages fail fast behavior for bugs
* is easy to debug when things fail
* encourages the developer write the parts of the code that are likely to need debugging
* encourages the developer write the parts of the code that are likely vary most with use case

To achieve an elegant design you need:

* a solid understanding of the requirements
* years of experience from iterative improvement
* an unquenchable thrust to learn from others
* some lateral thinking
* an appreciation for feedback
* to start small
* an iterative development approach
* a healthy resistance to unnecessary and unprofitable features
* a pragmatic approach to compromise

You can see implementations for some of GantSign's elegant designs in our
[open source projects]({{ base_path}}/opensource).
