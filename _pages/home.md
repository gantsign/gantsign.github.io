    excerpt: >
      Microservices are great way to deliver large projects in a shorter
      timescale. While many companies want to benefit from the advantages of
      microservices few have the experience to deliver microservice projects
      successfully. Get yourself ready for microservices by watching our
      introductory video.

    excerpt: >
      Replace slow, error prone, manual processes with fast, reliable, version
      controlled, scriptable processes. One of the best things about DevOps is
      it make it easier to share solutions; GantSign have open sourced our
      [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) built development environment and
      several [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) roles used to provision it.

      provides more reliable results, requires less ongoing effort, provides
      fast feedback, and allows you to spend more time encouraging your team
