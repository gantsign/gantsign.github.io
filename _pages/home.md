    excerpt: >
      Microservices are great way to deliver large projects in a shorter
      timescale. While many companies want to benefit from the advantages of
      microservices, few have the experience to deliver microservice projects
      successfully. Get yourself ready for microservices by watching our
      introductory video.

  - title: DevOps
    excerpt: >
      Replace slow, error prone, manual processes with fast, reliable, version
      controlled, scriptable processes. One of the best things about DevOps is
      it makes it easier to share solutions; GantSign have open sourced our
      Vagrant built development environment and several Ansible roles used to
      provision it.

    excerpt: >
      GantSign has open sourced our tooling and Checkstyle rules to aid you in
      writing great quality Java code. Using tooling to drive up quality,
      provides more reliable results, requires less ongoing effort, provides
      fast feedback, and allows you to spend more time encouraging your team
      rather than listing their coding flaws.
